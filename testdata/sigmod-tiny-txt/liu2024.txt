The goal of this study was to use a new interpretable machine-learning framework based on max-logistic competing risk factor
models to identify a parsimonious set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that play a pivotal role in the development ofcolorectal cancer (CRC). Transcriptome data from nine public datasets were analyzed, and a new Chinese cohort was collected tovalidate the ﬁndings. The study discovered a set of four critical DEGs - CXCL8, PSMC2, APP, and SLC20A1 - that exhibit the highest
accuracy in detecting CRC in diverse populations and ethnicities. Notably, PSMC2 and CXCL8 appear to play a central role in CRC,
and CXCL8 alone could potentially serve as an early-stage marker for CRC. This work represents a pioneering effort in applying themax-logistic competing risk factor model to identify critical genes for human malignancies, and the interpretability and
reproducibility of the results across diverse populations suggests that the four DEGs identi ﬁed can provide a comprehensive
description of the transcriptomic features of CRC. The practical implications of this research include the potential for personalizedrisk assessment and precision diagnosis and tailored treatment plans for patients.

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a signi ﬁcant public health issue, being
one of the most prevalent human malignancies worldwide andthe second leading cause of cancer-related deaths
1–3. While
surgical resection, chemoradiation, and immunotherapy haveadvanced, they remain inadequate in many cases. Moreover, theincidence of CRC is increasing in younger individuals, particularlyin the United States and other countries
4–6. Genetic predisposition
plays a crucial role in the development of CRC, with hereditary andsporadic causes accounting for a signi ﬁcant proportion of
cases
2,6,7. The etiology of CRC can be broadly classi ﬁed into two
categories: hereditary or sporadic. Hereditary CRC accounts for10−15% of the overall incidence and is attributable to mutations
in APC or DNA mismatch repair genes. Sporadic CRC is morefrequent, representing >80% of CRCs, and is characterized bychromosomal instability, microsatellite instability (MSI), or CpGisland methylation
6,7.
Over the past decades, many transcriptomic studies have been
performed which have shed light on the molecular mechanisms
underlying CRC development, with a large number of genes beingidenti ﬁed as differentially expressed between tumor and non-
tumor tissues
8–15. At the molecular level, CRC are classi ﬁed into
four consensus molecular subtypes (CMS), each of which ischaracterized by distinct expression pro ﬁles of oncogenic/tumor
suppressive genes and pathways, mutation states of particulargenes, MSI, and clinical outcomes
16,17, however their clinical utility
remains to be validated.So far, most transcriptomic studies have used traditional
analytical approaches which rely on fold changes of individual
genes between tumor and control tissues or pathway enrichment
analysis based on current knowledge of genes and biological
processes11,18–20. As a result, the number of genes/transcripts
reported is large and it is uncertain which of them plays a criticalrole in cancer identi ﬁcation and classi ﬁcation. Furthermore, gene-
gene interactions were not well addressed in traditional analytical
models. Thus, there is a need to develop novel analytical methods
to identify critical DEGs with high sensitivity and speci ﬁcity. Recent
advances in the machine learning community have shown great
promise for applying new methods to improve cancer identi ﬁca-
tion/classi ﬁcation and have demonstrated superior performance
over traditional methods
21–23.
In this study, we applied a newly proven and powerful machine-
learning method to identify a parsimonious subset of critical
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for CRC. Our method is
based on the max-logistic competing structure, which takes into
account the competing relationships among genes in predicting
the outcome variable, including gene-gene interactions, a feature
not captured by traditional analytical models21–23. We analyzed
ten transcriptome pro ﬁling datasets, including nine public
datasets and one separate transcriptome dataset collected from
a Chinese population. Using the max-logistic competing risk factormodels, we identi ﬁed four critical DEGs, namely, CXCL8 (C-X-C
Motif Chemokine Ligand 8), PSMC2 (Proteasome 26S Subunit,
ATPase 2), APP (Amyloid Beta Precursor Protein), and SLC20A1

performed in the TCGA Colon Cancer (COAD) cohort using the Illumina HiSeq 2000
RNA Sequencing platform46. Gene expression values were log2(norm count +1)
transformed. The “normal ”samples were adjacent nontumor colorectal tissues. The
data link is https://gdc-hub.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/download/TCGA-
COAD.htseq_counts.tsv.gz . We noted that this dataset was expanded from 349
samples to 512 samples since we ﬁrst downloaded from the website. We used
349 samples in our initial data analysis. In our analysis of the second dataset, we used
512 samples which had different measurements from the ﬁrst dataset (see below).
The second public dataset was also obtained from the NCI ’s GDC and included 471
CRC samples and 41 normal controls (a total of 512 samples). This RNA-seq study wasperformed in the TCGA COAD cohort using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 RNA Sequencing
platform
46. The expression values were normalized with log2(Fragments Per Kilobase
of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM) +1). In our computation, the
expression values were further transformed using a natural logarithm operator. The“normal ”samples were adjacent normal colon/rectal tissues. The data link is: https://
gdc-hub.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/download/TCGA-COAD.htseq_fpkm.tsv.gz .
Theﬁrst dataset and the second dataset had measurement heterogeneity which may
cause batch effects when applying classical statistical models and classi ﬁcations. Our
newly proposed max-logistic competing regression can overcome the batch effectsby logarithm transformation of the second dataset (see below for details).The third public dataset (GEO Accession: GSE39582) was obtained from a studyperformed in Europe using the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrayplatform
11. This dataset included 566 CRC samples and 19 normal controls with
54,675 genes/transcripts. The expression values were derived from log2(normalized
intensity signal). This dataset included frozen tissue of primary colorectal
adenocarcinoma and its “normal ”samples were frozen tissue of non-tumoral
colorectal mucosa.
The fourth public dataset (GEO Accession: GSE9348) was obtained from a study
performed in a Han Chinese CRC cohort including 82 age-, ethnicity- and tissue-
matched healthy controls using the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2 array47. The patients were
classi ﬁed as early-stage CRC (Stage 1 or 2). Gene expression values were calculated
using the MAS5 algorithm. This dataset included tumor tissue collected and archivedwithin 30 minutes after surgery, and its “normal ”was colonic mucosa collected and
archived within 30 minutes after biopsy.
The ﬁfth public dataset (GEO Accession: GSE18105) was obtained from a study
performed in a Japanese cohort containing 77 CRC samples and 17 paired samplesfrom adjacent nontumor tissues
48. The patients were classi ﬁed as stages 2 or 3 CRC.
Gene expression values were derived from RMA signal intensities.The sixth public dataset (GEO Accession: GSE41258) was obtained from a studyperformed in an Israel population containing 299 samples, including 180 CRC, 46polyps, 43 normal colon, 21 liver metastases, and 9 lung metastases
49. Data were
normalized using the PLIER algorithm and batch corrected, then Lowess normalized
signals.
To validate the results of the discovery analysis, we collected a sample at Sun Yat-sen
University Cancer Center in Guangzhou, China, which included 45 CRC samples and47 normal controls collected from adjacent nontumor colonic tissues (seventhdataset). The genes identi ﬁed in the discovery analysis were validated using real-time
quantitative RT-PCR with the TaqMan Gene Expression assays (Applied Biosystems,
Inc.). In addition, the patients ’age, sex, TNM tumor stage, and histologic grade of the
tumor were included in the analyses. Regarding this new data collection,the following procedure had been utilized. Complying with the ‘Guidance of the
Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) for the Review and Approval of Human
Genetic Resources ’, this project obtained approval from the institutional ethics
committee (IEC) of Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. Experimental proceduresand data collection involving Chinese patients were conducted in China with the
participation of Chinese co-authors. This study obtained approval from the
institutional ethics committee (IEC) of Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, adheringto the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All experimental procedures wereconducted in compliance with the guidelines and regulations for the protection of
human subjects. Informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to their
participation in the study. No sequencing experiment was performed using the
clinical samples collected from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center in Guangzhou,China. Participants provided written informed consent to take part in all studies
conducted by Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. The four gene expression
values are made available for download from the datalink speci ﬁed in Code

Three additional public datasets (i.e., eighth, ninth and tenth) were included in this
study to further validate the ﬁndings and to ﬁt our models into preclassi ﬁed CMS.
The eighth public dataset was also obtained from the NCI ’s GDC and included 167
rectal cancer samples and 10 normal controls (adjacent normal rectal tissues). Thedata link is: https://gdc-hub.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/download/TCGA-
READ.htseq_fpkm.tsv.gz . Data from the same sample but from different vials/
portions/analytes/aliquotes was averaged; data from different samples was
combined into genomicMatrix. This RNA-seq study was performed in the TCGACOAD cohort using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 RNA Sequencing platform
46. Theexpression values were normalized with log2(Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per
Million mapped reads (FPKM) +1).
The ninth public dataset (GEO Accession: GSE103512) contained formalin- ﬁxed and
paraf ﬁn-embedded normal and tumor tissues of four cancer types, in which colon
cancer was included. The platform used was Affymetrix HT-U133plus-2-PM
microarrays50.
In this study, 57 CRC samples and 12 matched normal colon samples wereanalyzed
