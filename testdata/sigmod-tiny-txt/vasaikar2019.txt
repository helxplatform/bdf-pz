SUMMARY
We performed the ﬁrst proteogenomic study on
a prospectively collected colon cancer cohort.Comparative proteomic and phosphoproteomic
analysis of paired tumor and normal adjacent tis-
sues produced a catalog of colon cancer-associ-ated proteins and phosphosites, including knownand putative new biomarkers, drug targets, andcancer/testis antigens. Proteogenomic integrationnot only prioritized genomically inferred targets,such as copy-number drivers and mutation-derivedneoantigens, but also yielded novel ﬁndings. Phos-
phoproteomics data associated Rb phosphoryla-
tion with increased proliferation and decreasedapoptosis in colon cancer, which explains whythis classical tumor suppressor is ampliﬁed incolon tumors and suggests a rationale for targetingRb phosphorylation in colon cancer. Proteomicsidentiﬁed an association between decreased CD8T cell inﬁltration and increased glycolysis in micro-
satellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors, suggesting
glycolysis as a potential target to overcome theresistance of MSI-H tumors to immune check-point blockade. Proteogenomics presents newavenues for biological discoveries and therapeuticdevelopment.
INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer world-
wide and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths(Arnold et al., 2017 ). Recent studies of the genomic, transcrip-
tomic, and proteomic landscapes of human CRC have identiﬁed
many genomic alterations and have revealed extensive molecu-
lar heterogeneity of the disease ( Cancer Genome Atlas Network,
2012; Guinney et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2014 ). However, the
rapidly accumulating omics data have yet to bring novel bio-markers and drug targets to the clinic.
Global proteomic differences between tumor and normal tis-
sues, which are critical for cancer biomarker discovery, havenot been systematically characterized in large tumor cohorts.Signaling proteins and pathways are often attractive therapeutictargets for cancer treatment, yet global phosphoproteomic ana-
lyses on human CRC are lacking. Recent advances in cancer
immunotherapy underscore the critical need for biomarkers topredict response to immune checkpoint inhibition and to select
neoantigens for personalized vaccine development ( Sharma
et al., 2017 ). Proteogenomics can provide fresh approaches to
these needs. Here, we describe a proteogenomic study fromthe Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) on

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Specimens and Clinical Data
Tumor, adjacent normal, and blood samples were collected by several tissue source sites in strict accordance to the CPTAC-2 colonprocurement protocol ( https://brd.nci.nih.gov/brd/sop/download-pdf/321 ) with an informed consent from the patients. The
Washington University in St. Louis Institutional Review Board (IRB) reviewed the individual informed consent documents at each tissuesource site and determined that the materials sent to the CPTAC biospecimen core resource met the requirements for Exemption 4.The cohort had an inclusion criterion of newly diagnosed, untreated patients undergoing primary surgery for colon adenocarcinoma.Because untreated rectal tumors are difﬁcult to obtain, we only included colon cancers, which represent approximately 70% of all
CRCs. Patients with prior history of other malignancies within 12 months, any systemic chemotherapy, endocrine or biological therapy
as well as prior radiation therapy to the abdomen or pelvis for any cancer type were excluded from the study. Required clinical infor-mation regarding patient history and status of surgery along with relevant diagnostic information were collected using case reports
forms. One year follow up information with updated history after completion of the initial treatment regimen were also collected through
follow up forms. Deidentiﬁed pathology reports and representative diagnostic slide images were utilized to review and qualify cases forthis study. The peripheral venous blood from the same patient were collected prior to administration of anesthesia. Segments from
qualiﬁed tumor specimens were greater than 300mg in mass with at least 60% tumor cell nuclei and less than 20% necrosis. To ensure
tissue suitability for phosphoprotein analysis, the tissue and the adjacent normal specimens were collected in less than30 minutes total ischemic time and embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound for processing at a commonCPTAC-2 specimen core resource center. Pathologically qualiﬁed cases underwent further molecular qualiﬁcation for extraction
and co-isolation of nucleic acids. Tissue segments that were pathology and molecular qualiﬁed were shipped to the proteomic
characterization centers. DNA and RNA from the same tumor segment and DNA from germline blood were further aliquoted and quan-tiﬁed per protocol. DNA quality was conﬁrmed using gel electrophoresis and Nano drop methods. RNA quality was conﬁrmed using
Nano drop and Agilent bioanalyzer. Sufﬁcient yield, a good gel score and passing value of 7 or greater RIN qualiﬁed the DNA and RNA,
respectively, for sequencing. The analytes were then shipped to the sequencing center. The corresponding clinical data wereformatted and distributed through the CPTAC data coordinating center ( https://cptac-data-portal.georgetown.edu/cptac/s/S037 ).
Table S1 summarizes the clinical and pathological characteristics of the tumors and the speciﬁc numbers of samples analyzed by
each omics platform. Among the 110 patients in the cohort, there were 65 females (60%) and 45 males (40%), with an average ageof 65 (range 40 to 93 years). We did not perform analyses on the two sexes separately because the sample size is too small after
sex stratiﬁcation. Moreover, we were interested in results common to both sexes, and the sex distribution is reasonably balanced.
METHODS DETAILS
PCR-based MSI Analysis
The MSI Analysis System (version 1.2, Promega), a ﬂuorescent PCR-based assay, was used to detect microsatellite instability (MSI)in the colon tumors. The analysis compares allelic proﬁles of microsatellite markers generated by ampliﬁcation of DNA from matching
tumor and normal samples, and alleles that are present in the tumor sample but not in corresponding normal samples indicate MSI.
The system uses seven markers including ﬁve mononucleotide repeat markers (BAT-25, BAT-26, NR-21, NR-24, and MONO-27) andtwo pentanucleotide repeat markers (Penta C and Penta D). The output data were analyzed with GeneMapper /C226software (Applied
Biosystems) to determine MSI status of the colon tumor samples.
Genotyping Array Analysis
Genomic DNA samples were prepared according to Illumina’s Inﬁnium LCG Quad Assay manual protocol. Processed samples were
loaded on the HumanOmni5-Quad BeadChips and run on the HiScan platform. SNP and CNP genotyping were performed with the
Genome Studio Genotyping Module (Version 2.0, Illumina).
Whole Exome Sequencing
Genomic DNA samples were used to prepare indexed libraries using the Nextera Rapid Capture Exome kit from Illumina. Librarypreparation was performed using a semi-automated 96-well plate method, with washing and clean-up/concentration steps per-
formed on the Beckman Coulter Biomek NXP platform and with ZR-96 DNA Clean & Concentrator-5 plates, respectively. Libraries
were quantiﬁed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Pooled libraries were run on HiSeq4000 (2x150 paired end runs) to achieve aminimum of 150x on target coverage per each sample library. The raw Illumina sequence data were demultiplexed and converted
to fastq ﬁles, adaptor and low-quality sequences were trimmed. Whole exome sequencing (WXS) data were used for somatic
mutation detection, microsatellite instability prediction, and somatic copy number alteration (SCNA) analysis as described below.
Somatic Mutation Detection
We followed the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK, version 3.8.0) best practice guideline for somatic short variant discovery (https://
software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/best-practices/workﬂow?id=11146 ). Brieﬂy, we aligned paired-end WXS reads to the human refer-
ence genome (hg19) with BWA-mem (version 0.7.15-r1140). The bam ﬁles were further processed by adding read groups, marking
